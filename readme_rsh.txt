============== Environment =================

Application developed in the standard python 3.6 environment or up ( uses f"" so do not go < 3.6 )
Windows 10 Pro, but should work on any Python 3.6 environment and up
GUI in tkinter mostly ttk
tasks tend to be quick so this app is single threaded -- probably not moving to multithreaded

We are now watching "Grand Prince" on Vicki. We're on episode 15 of 20. Very good acting,
Love triangle with lots of political intrigue and far more complex emotions than usual.
The "barbarian" secondary character is wonderful with her very few words but great facial expressions.
Somewhat contrived plot of course.
