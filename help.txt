======== Purpose ========


This application enables key word search of may web sites with just
a little typing and a few clicks.

Web sites to be searched can be set up in collections of either "lists", or 
"groups".  Each individual site to be searched is setup via an object
called a "web searcher", each web searcher is given a mnemonic name, for example
lime might be given to a web searcher that searches lime torrents.

 
    *lists: 
        are named and specified in the parameter file of the application, you can
        set up pretty much any ( reasonably finite ) number of lists as
        you want.
        
    *groups:
        when a searcher is defined it is assigned to a list of groups, just string
        names that define the groups.  You can have as many groups ( rf ) as you want
        and a searcher may belong to as many ( rf ) groups as you want.
        
Running the app:

    Start it, type in some search words, select either a list of web searchers ( via dropdown )
    or a set of groups ( via check boxes ). and press button <Search Web>

    Hint:
        before pressing <Search Web> you may wish to open a new empty web browser window
        ( in you default browser ) each web search will ( in firefox anyway ) open in
        a new tab of that window.
    
Configuration:

    This involves coding!  Parameter are in parameters.py see the file and also: tbd
    
    To add new searches add to: search_objects_p1.py ( directions in file )
    
    If you want more search configuration file, build ones like search_objects_p1.py
